# Phase 4: Visitor View - Displaying User Pages

> **Note**: Follow [code_guidelines.md](./code_guidelines.md) for all implementation work.

This phase focuses on creating the public-facing components that visitors see when they view a user's profile page. We need to build visitor view components for each block type and update the main profile page to display content dynamically.

## Phase 4 Overview

**Current Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

The creator editing experience is complete (Phase 3). The visitor experience has now been fully implemented - public profile pages beautifully showcase user blocks in a clean, readable format with full SEO support.

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Considerations

- **Component Structure**: All visitor view components should follow a consistent pattern and be located in `/src/features/blocks/components/`
- **Data Flow**: Public profile pages should use server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- **Responsive Design**: All components must work well on mobile devices since profile sharing often happens on mobile
- **Performance**: Consider image optimization and lazy loading for media-heavy profiles

### Future Extensibility

- The `BlockRenderer` component should be designed to easily accommodate new block types
- Consider how block configurations (`config` JSONB field) might affect visitor view rendering
- Plan for potential visibility/privacy controls on blocks

## Dependencies

This phase depends on:

- ✅ Phase 3: Creator editing functionality must be complete
- ✅ Existing user authentication and profile infrastructure
- ✅ Block data model and database schema
