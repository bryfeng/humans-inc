5. **Editor Integration & Adaptation** (8.5) - Ensures all editors work in new layout
6. **Integration Testing & Polish** (8.6) - Final testing and optimization

## Technical Considerations

### Component Changes

- **CreateSection.tsx**: Complete redesign with split-panel layout
- **Block Editors**: Adapt for panel layout (minor changes)
