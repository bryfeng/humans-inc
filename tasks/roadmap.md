Project Summary & Core Concepts
This document outlines the plan for building humans.inc, a platform designed to provide users with a unified and beautiful online presence. The long-term vision is to build a repository for human consciousness, starting with a platform that elegantly combines a personal bio, curated content, and a blogging/newsletter engine.

The core of the project is the humans.inc/username page, a single, creator-controlled destination that represents an individual's curated thoughts and identity online.

Core Concepts
Unified Identity: Each user gets a single, clean URL (humans.inc/username) that acts as their personal hub, replacing the need for scattered links to blogs, bios, and social profiles.
Modular Content Blocks: The user page is built from customizable blocks that can be reordered via drag-and-drop. The V1 blocks include:
Bio Block: For a profile picture, tagline, and key personal links.
Curated Content Block: For sharing and annotating external content like YouTube videos and articles.
Writings Block: For hosting the user's original long-form content (blog posts/essays).
Creator-Centric Experience: The primary focus of V1 is on making the creation and maintenance of the page a delightful and addictive experience, inspired by the customization of Notion.
V1 Simplicity: The initial version prioritizes the creator's page editing experience and the visitor's viewing experience. Features like direct newsletter-sending capabilities are deferred to a future version.
Long-Term Vision: While V1 is a practical tool, every feature is designed with the broader goal in mind: creating a lasting, searchable, and meaningful repository of individual consciousness.
