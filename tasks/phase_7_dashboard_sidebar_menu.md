# Phase 7: Dashboard Sidebar Menu - Left Navigation & Content Sections

> **Note**: Follow [code_guidelines.md](./code_guidelines.md) for all implementation work.

This phase focuses on transforming the current dashboard layout into a modern sidebar-based interface with four main sections: Page Preview, Inbox, Drafts, and Create. This will provide better organization and user experience for content management.

- **Database Changes**:

  ```sql
  -- Add is_published column to blocks table
  ALTER TABLE public.blocks
  ADD COLUMN is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

  -- Add index for efficient draft queries
  CREATE INDEX blocks_user_published_idx ON public.blocks(user_id, is_published, updated_at DESC);
  ```

### 7.6 Section Integration & State Management
