# Collections Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a collections system to organize content blocks, addressing the user's request to:

1. Adjust pages and how blocks are managed
2. Categorize content into groups (collections/folders)
3. Separate block management from profile preview

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- Created collections table with proper relationships
- Added collection_id foreign key to blocks table
- Set up RLS policies for security
- Added indexes for performance

### 2. Backend Actions (`src/features/collections/actions/index.ts`)

- `getUserCollections()` - Fetch user's collections
- `createCollection()` - Create new collection
- `updateCollection()` - Update existing collection
- `deleteCollection()` - Delete collection (moves blocks to uncategorized)
- `moveBlockToCollection()` - Move blocks between collections
- `getBlocksByCollection()` - Get blocks grouped by collection

### 3. Dashboard Structure Refinement

- Updated `DashboardSidebar` with new sections:
  - **Page Preview** - See how profile looks to visitors
  - **Manage Blocks** - Organize and manage content blocks (NEW)
  - **Collections** - Group content into collections (NEW)
  - **Create** - Create new content blocks
  - **Drafts** - Manage draft content
  - **Inbox** - Manage incoming content

### 4. New Dashboard Sections

#### ManageBlocksSection

- Advanced block management interface
- Filter by type, collection, or search query
- Grid and list view modes
- Bulk selection and actions
- Move blocks between collections
- Quick publish/delete actions
- Shows blocks grouped by collection

#### CollectionsSection

- Create and manage collections
- Edit collection names, descriptions, and visibility
- View block counts per collection
- Delete collections (blocks move to uncategorized)
- Statistics dashboard

### 5. User Experience Improvements

- **Separation of Concerns**: Block management is now separate from profile preview
- **Better Organization**: Collections provide clear content categorization
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Multiple ways to find and organize content
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple blocks for batch operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear status indicators (draft, hidden, published)

## Key Features

### Collections

- Named groups for organizing blocks
- Optional descriptions
- Public/private visibility settings
- Automatic "Uncategorized" collection for unassigned blocks

### Block Management

- Filter by type (bio, text, links, etc.)
- Filter by collection
- Search functionality
- Drag-and-drop style organization
- Quick actions (edit, move, publish, delete)

### Dashboard Navigation

- Intuitive sidebar with clear section purposes
- Visual icons and descriptions
- Smooth transitions between sections

## Database Requirements

Run the SQL migration in `database/migrations/001_create_collections.sql` to set up the required tables and relationships.

## Files Modified/Created

- `src/features/collections/actions/index.ts` (NEW)
- `src/components/dashboard/sections/ManageBlocksSection.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/dashboard/sections/CollectionsSection.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx` (UPDATED)

## Next Steps

1. Run database migration in Supabase
2. Test the new collections functionality
3. Consider adding drag-and-drop reordering
4. Add collection-based public profile views
5. Implement collection sharing features
