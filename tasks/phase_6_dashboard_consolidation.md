# Phase 6: Dashboard Consolidation & UX Improvements

> **Note**: Follow [code_guidelines.md](./code_guidelines.md) for all implementation work.

This phase focuses on consolidating the sparse dashboard with content management functionality and improving routing for authenticated users to create a unified, comprehensive dashboard experience.

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Changes

- Task 6.3: Major dashboard page restructure with component integration
- Task 6.3: Deleting edit-profile page and updating navigation

### Mitigation Strategies

- Test `npm run build` after each task completion
- Implement changes incrementally with individual commits
- Test authentication flows and data fetching after each change
- Maintain comprehensive backup of critical files before major changes
- Validate all existing user flows remain functional

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies Required

- `BlockCreator` from `@/features/blocks/components`
- `BlockList` from `@/features/blocks/components`
- `ProfileForm` from `@/features/profile/components/ProfileForm`
- `getProfileWithBlocks` from `@/features/blocks/actions`
- Existing authentication utilities and middleware

### New Components to Create

- `src/components/dashboard/ProfileHeader.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardActions.tsx`

### Files to Modify

- `src/middleware.ts` - Add authenticated user routing
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Add auth check and redirect
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Major restructure and consolidation

### Files to Remove

- `src/app/dashboard/edit-profile/page.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/edit-profile/` directory (if becomes empty)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All content management functionality is accessible from main dashboard
- [ ] Profile editing works seamlessly with inline/modal interface
- [ ] Sign out and authentication flows remain functional
- [ ] No broken navigation links or missing routes

### User Experience Requirements

- [ ] Dashboard feels comprehensive and feature-rich, not sparse
- [ ] Information density is appropriate - informative but not overwhelming
- [ ] Navigation is intuitive and efficient for content management
- [ ] Mobile experience supports full dashboard functionality
- [ ] Loading and interaction states provide clear user feedback

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with no errors or warnings
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors

- [ ] Application performance remains acceptable (no significant slowdowns)
- [ ] Authentication and routing work correctly across all scenarios

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 6.1)

Focus on routing changes to establish proper user flow without affecting existing functionality.

### Phase 2: Component Development (Task 6.2)

Build dashboard components in isolation to ensure they work correctly before integration.

### Phase 3: Integration (Task 6.3)

Perform major dashboard consolidation with careful testing at each step.

### Phase 4: Polish (Task 6.4)

Add UX improvements and visual enhancements to create a premium experience.

## Notes

- This phase requires careful attention to user authentication flows
- Each task should be committed separately for easy rollback capability
- Test with multiple user scenarios (new users, users with content, etc.)
- Pay special attention to mobile experience since dashboard management is critical
- Monitor for any performance impact from loading more components on single page
- Consider user feedback and usage patterns when implementing progressive disclosure

## Dependencies

This phase depends on:

- ✅ Existing authentication and profile infrastructure
- ✅ Block creation and management functionality from Phase 3
- ✅ Block rendering and display components from Phase 4
- ✅ Styling foundation and design system from Phase 5

## Estimated Timeline

**1-2 weeks** for complete implementation, testing, and polish.
