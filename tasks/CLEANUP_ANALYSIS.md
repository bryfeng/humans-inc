- **Status**: Current and comprehensive
- **Action**: Keep as-is

#### `styling_guide.md` ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

- **Purpose**: Complete design system and visual standards
- **Value**: OKLCH color system, typography, component patterns, animations
- **AI Agent Use**: Reference for all UI/UX work and visual consistency
- **Status**: Comprehensive and up-to-date
- **Action**: Keep as-is

#### `roadmap.md` üìã **REFERENCE**

- **Purpose**: High-level project vision and feature roadmap
- **Value**: Context for long-term goals and V1 scope
- **AI Agent Use**: Understanding project direction and priorities
- **Status**: Mostly complete through Phase 6
- **Action**: Keep for historical context and future planning

### üü° **KEEP - Active Tech Debt Documentation**

These files contain actionable items that need to be addressed:

#### `tech_debt_general.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTIONABLE**

- **Purpose**: Infrastructure and tooling improvements needed
- **Value**: Specific, prioritized technical improvements
- **AI Agent Use**: Task list for improving code quality and developer experience
- **Status**: All items still relevant and unaddressed
- **Action**: Keep until items are resolved

#### `tech_debt_tailwind_dark_variants.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTIONABLE**

- **Purpose**: Specific Tailwind CSS v4 dark mode issue
- **Value**: Detailed troubleshooting documentation and workaround
- **AI Agent Use**: Reference for dark mode implementation and debugging
- **Status**: Issue still exists, workaround in place
- **Action**: Keep until resolved or Tailwind v4 stabilizes

### üîÑ **CONSOLIDATE - Historical Phase Documentation**

These phase files have served their purpose but contain valuable context:

#### `phase_6_dashboard_consolidation.md` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Value**: Architecture decisions and component integration patterns
- **Action**: Archive key learnings, remove detailed task tracking

#### `phase_4_visitor_view.md` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- **Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive component library
- **Value**: SEO implementation patterns and public view architecture
- **Action**: Archive component patterns, remove task details

#### `phase_3_core_blocks.md` ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- **Status**: Complete creator experience with flexible block system
- **Value**: Database schema and JSONB content modeling approach
- **Action**: Archive schema design, remove implementation tasks

#### `phase_5_refinements_polish.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**

- **Status**: Some items complete, many refinements pending
- **Value**: Performance optimization and UX improvement roadmap
- **Action**: Extract incomplete items to active tech debt

## Tech Debt Summary

### üî¥ **High Priority**

_Blocking safe development and refactoring_

1. **Testing Infrastructure Missing**

   - No Vitest + React Testing Library setup
   - No automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
   - Risk: Unsafe refactoring, bugs in production

2. **Tailwind Dark Mode Broken**
   - `dark:` variants not working with Tailwind CSS v4
   - Currently using CSS variable workarounds
   - Risk: Inconsistent theming, verbose styling code

### üü° **Medium Priority**

_Code quality and maintainability_

3. **ESLint Boundaries Plugin Missing**

   - No enforcement of feature slice boundaries
   - Risk: Tight coupling between features

4. **Prettier Tailwind Plugin Missing**

   - Inconsistent class ordering
   - Risk: Reduced code readability

5. **Phase 5 Refinements Incomplete**
   - SEO metadata generation not implemented
   - Accessibility improvements pending
   - Performance optimizations partial
   - Error handling and loading states incomplete

### üü¢ **Low Priority**

_Organizational improvements_

6. **Duplicate lib/ Directories**

   - Both root `lib/` and `src/lib/` exist
   - Risk: Import confusion

7. **PostCSS Config Backup File**
   - `postcss.config.mjs.bak` in repository
   - Risk: Repository clutter (low impact)

## Recommendations for AI Agents

### Immediate References

For any new AI agents working on this codebase:

1. **Start with**: `code_guidelines.md` and `styling_guide.md`
2. **Architecture Context**: Review `roadmap.md` for project vision
3. **Current Issues**: Check `tech_debt_general.md` for known problems

### Development Patterns

Key patterns established in the codebase:

- **Feature-based architecture** with strict boundaries
- **JSONB flexibility** for block content modeling
- **Server actions** for all data mutations
- **CSS variables** for theme-aware styling (workaround for Tailwind issue)
- **Component composition** over inheritance

### Critical Dependencies

- Supabase for auth and database
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 (with known dark mode limitations)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Feature-slice architectural boundaries

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: File Cleanup (Immediate)

1. Delete obsolete phase files (0, 1, 2) and `features.md`
2. Create consolidated `ARCHITECTURE.md` from phase documentation
3. Move active items from Phase 5 to `tech_debt_general.md`

### Phase 2: Tech Debt Resolution (Priority Order)

1. Implement testing infrastructure (Vitest + RTL)
2. Resolve Tailwind dark mode issue or document permanent workaround
3. Add ESLint boundaries and Prettier Tailwind plugins
4. Address Phase 5 incomplete items based on priority

### Phase 3: Documentation Enhancement

1. Create component documentation from phase learnings
2. Update `roadmap.md` with post-V1 vision
3. Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
